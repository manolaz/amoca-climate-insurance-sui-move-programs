# AMOCA Climate Insurance

A decentralized parametric climate insurance protocol built on Sui using the Anchor framework. AMOCA provides automated climate risk protection through verifiable environmental data from oracles, enabling instant payouts when predefined climate thresholds are met.

## 🌍 Overview

Climate change poses increasing risks to agriculture, property, and livelihoods worldwide. Traditional insurance is slow, expensive, and often inaccessible to those who need it most. AMOCA Climate Insurance solves this through:

- **Parametric Triggers**: Automatic payouts based on objective climate data (rainfall, temperature, wind speed, etc.)
- **Oracle Integration**: Real-time data from satellites, weather stations, and IoT sensors
- **Instant Settlements**: Smart contract-based payouts without lengthy claims processes
- **Global Accessibility**: Decentralized protocol accessible to anyone worldwide
- **Transparent Operations**: All policies, triggers, and payouts are verifiable on-chain

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Climate Policies**: Smart contracts defining coverage terms, geographic bounds, and trigger conditions
2. **Oracle Network**: Decentralized data providers submitting verified climate information
3. **Risk Pool**: Automated treasury managing premiums and payouts
4. **Trigger Engine**: Parametric evaluation system for automated claim processing

### Supported Climate Risks

- 🌧️ **Drought Protection**: Based on rainfall measurements
- 🌊 **Flood Insurance**: Water level and precipitation monitoring  
- 🌪️ **Hurricane Coverage**: Wind speed and pressure tracking
- 🌾 **Agricultural Climate**: Multi-parameter crop protection
- 🔥 **Wildfire Protection**: Fire proximity and weather conditions
- 🌊 **Sea Level Rise**: Coastal monitoring and protection
- 🌡️ **Extreme Temperature**: Heat/cold wave protection
